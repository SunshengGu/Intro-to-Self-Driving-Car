# Intro-to-Self-Driving-Car
This repository contains some of the projects I completed for Udacity's Intro to Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

# A-Star Route Planner
This is one of the projects that I completed for Udacity's Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree. It takes a map of nodes as input. The coordinates of each node as well as the neighboring points of each node are stored in the map. I implemented an A-Star search algorithm to find the shortest path between a starting node and a destination node. 

# Traffic Light Classifier
This is the final project for the Intro to SDC ND. It uses computer vision (OpenCV) to process and classify images into red, green, and yellow lights. Techniques used include resizing, cropping, masking, feature extraction, and classifying. An accuracy rate of 96.6% was achieved.
